# Churn Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer churn analysis using Power BI. The goal is to visualize key churn metrics, identify factors influencing customer retention, and provide insights to minimize churn rates. The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Provides an intuitive visual representation of customer churn data.
- **Key Metrics:** Churn rate, retention rate, customer segmentation, and revenue impact.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing customer behavior, contract types, and service usage trends.
- **Predictive Insights:** Identifying factors contributing to churn.
- **Filter & Drill-Down Options:** Enables deep dives into customer segments and trends.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- **Customer ID:** Unique identifier for customers
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Service Details:** Type of subscription, usage statistics
- **Contract Information:** Monthly/annual plans, payment methods
- **Churn Status:** Indicates whether a customer has churned

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and format the dataset.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Transform categorical variables if needed.
2. **Importing Data into Power BI:**
   - Load the dataset into Power BI.
   - Set up relationships between tables.
3. **Building Visualizations:**
   - Create KPI cards for churn rate and retention rate.
   - Use bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for insights.
   - Implement slicers and filters for interactive exploration.
4. **Analysis & Insights:**
   - Identify high-risk customer segments.
   - Analyze churn patterns based on service usage and contract type.
5. **Sharing Reports:**
   - Publish to Power BI service.
   - Share dashboards with stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing)
- SQL (if required for data extraction)

## Insights & Recommendations
- **High churn rates in monthly contracts:** Encourage customers to switch to annual plans.
- **Payment method impact:** Customers using manual payment methods have higher churn.
- **Customer support influence:** Improved customer service reduces churn.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn patterns. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s visualization capabilities, businesses can take data-driven actions to improve customer retention strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with predictive models using Python or R.
- Real-time churn monitoring using Power BI streaming datasets.
- Customer sentiment analysis using text analytics.
